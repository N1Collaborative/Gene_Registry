  <h1>N1C Gene Registry Info</h1>

  <div class="content-box">
    <h2>1. How to navigate the registry</h2>
    <p>
      This registry is divided into two parts. That can be accessed via the buttons on the main page. The search function on the main page allows to search in both registries.<br>
      <strong>1. N-of-1 Projects</strong>  <br>
      This part of the registry lists ongoing n-of-1 and n-of-few projects by N1C members as well as collaborators and further organizations. The projects are listed alphabetically by gene name. 
      Each project can be opened as its own entry, containing additional information on the variant, status of the project, availability of Investigational New Drug Application (IND),
      and cell lines/animal models. Additionally, the entry pages also contain contact information of the lab and PI to reach out to. The search function
      will search the full registry, including parts of the entries that are not visible in the main table.<br>
      <strong>2. Marketed Genetic Therapies</strong>  <br>
      This registry contains the Marketed Genetic Therapies available for larger groups of patients. The overview table is sorted alphabetically by marketed durg name.
      No single entries are available here. The search function will search through all marketed therapies.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Thank you</h2>
    <p>
      This registry is provided by the N=1 Collaborative and run by the Patient Identification Working Group.
      We want to thank all contributors to this registry, especially Kailee Yap and Andy Drackley (Center for Genomics, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago) who maintain the registry, as well as David Cheerie (SickKids, Toronto), Nicole Nolen (N1C), and Marlen Lauffer (Dutch Center for RNA Therapeutics, Leiden).
