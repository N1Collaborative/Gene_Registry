    "Assessment text": "The variant [NM_001040142.2:c.5636T>C (p.Met1879Thr)] in SCN2A is classified as LP for Autosomal dominant SCN2A-related disorder. This variant is located in exon27, 271 bp from [distance from donor or acceptor splice site/ branchpoint] of the SCN2A. The mechanism by which this variant impairs protein function is gain-of-function(PMID: 32750235). There is published evidence(PMID:34850743,40263630) that ASO/RNAi/siRNA has already been developed and shown to work with available functional evidence. In light of the current evidence and in accordance with the consensus guidelines for assessing eligibility of pathogenic DNA variants for antisense oligonucleotide treatments, this variant is considered Eligible for knockdown ASO therapy."
